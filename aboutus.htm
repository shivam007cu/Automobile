Welcome to Automobiles - India's largest auto media vehicle. Automobiles has always striven to serve car buyers and owners in the most comprehensive and convenient way possible. We provide a platform where car buyers and owners can research, buy, sell and come together to discuss and talk about their cars.

Our Mission:

Our mission is to bring joy and delight into car buying and ownership.

To achieve this goal, we aim to empower Indian consumers to make informed car buying and ownership decisions with exhaustive and un-biased information on cars through our expert reviews, owner reviews, detailed specifications and comparisons. We understand that a car is by and large the second-most expensive asset a consumer associates his lifestyle with.

A Brief History:

Automobiles was launched in October 2005 by Mohit, Gaurav, Tufail and Arun. Since then we have been credited with several initiatives for Indian car consumers.

In 2005, we became the first website in India to consolidate used car inventory across dealers and present it to car buyers as an online marketplace.

In 2006, we launched India’s first Used Car Price Guide. For the first time, a used car buyer or seller could see what was the actual market value of their vehicle, depending on the car’s model, variant, age, condition, mileage, city and whether they were transacting with a dealer or an individual. Today, Automobiles’s Used Car Price Guide stands as India’s most comprehensive and credible source of information on used car prices. We offer prices for all the popular cars sold in India since 1991 across 28 cities.

In 2007, we launched India’s most comprehensive resource on car research, along with several tools and features such as Recommend-Me-A-Car, compare cars, owner reviews, and one of our most popular features –on-road prices. We offer on-road prices of all cars available in India for 200 cities and towns.

In 2008, we announced voting for India’s first consumer choice car awards. We got over 1.6 lakh responses from car buyers and owners, making it India’s most credible car awards – a true voice of the people of India.

In 2009, we started a unique model of offering free car consultation to car buyers across India. We also helped them with dealer quotations and test drives at their doorstep. We also brought together loan processing and insurance options so a buyer could actually get the best available car price, the cheapest loan and the lowest insurance quote. All this without so much as leaving your seat

We also started a unique event called Vintage Wheels, which is an annual two week long exhibition-cum-drive of vintage cars

In 2010, we became India’s single largest source of car sales. A small but precious achievement for us. We also became India’s first car website to have it’s own full-fledged editorial team, complete with industry-class equipment to test cars to their limit and publish our own expert reviews.

Awards:

Along the way, we have been recognised for a few achievements.

Red Herring Global 200 (2010) – We were recognised as one of the world’s top 200 innovative IT companies by Red Herring.
